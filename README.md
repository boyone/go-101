Write a function accepting a list of non negative integers, 
and returning their largest possible combined number
as a string. For example

given [50, 2, 1, 9] it returns "95021"    (9 + 50 + 2 + 1)
given [5, 50, 56]   it returns "56550"    (56 + 5 + 50)
given 420, 42, 423] it returns "42423420" (42 + 423 + 420)
